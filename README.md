# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI dashboard solution designed to enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights into emergency room performance. The solution enables stakeholders to track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding patient management and service optimization.
## Project Overview

The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard project aims to transform raw ER data into meaningful, actionable insights through a series of interconnected Power BI dashboards. By visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and patient demographics, this tool helps healthcare professionals identify patterns, anomalies, and areas for improvement, ultimately optimizing emergency room operations and patient care.
## Features

The dashboard solution is composed of four distinct dashboards, each serving a specific objective:

### 1. Monthly View Dashboard

**Objective:** Monitor key metrics and trends on a month-by-month basis to identify patterns and areas for improvement.

**Key Metrics & Charts:**
* **Number of Patients:** Total number of patients visiting the ER daily, with a daily trend area sparkline.
* **Average Wait Time:** Average time patients wait before being attended to, with a daily fluctuation area sparkline.
* **Patient Satisfaction Score:** Average satisfaction score of patients daily, with a daily trend area sparkline.
* **Number of Patients Referred:** Count of patients referred to specific departments each day, with a daily trend area sparkline.
* **Patient Admission Status:** Tracks admitted vs. non-admitted patients.
* **Patient Age Distribution:** Groups patients by 10-year age intervals.
* **Department Referrals:** Analyzes referral trends across different departments.
* **Timeliness:** Measures the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.
* **Gender Analysis:** Visualizes patient distribution by gender.
* **Racial Demographics:** Analyzes patient data by race.
* **Time Analysis:** Assesses patient volume by day and hour.

### 2. Consolidated View Dashboard

**Objective:** Provide a holistic summary of hospital performance for a selected date range.

**Key Metrics & Charts:**
* This dashboard includes similar metrics and charts as the Monthly View but aggregated over a customizable date range for broader insights and trend analysis.

### 3. Patient Details Dashboard

**Objective:** Offer granular insights into patient-level data to enable detailed analysis and troubleshooting.

**Key Fields Displayed (in a grid format):**
* Patient ID
* Patient Full Name
* Gender
* Age
* Admission Date
* Patient Race
* Wait Time
* Department Referral
* Admission Status
## Technologies Used


* **Power BI:** The primary tool used for dashboard development, data modeling, visualization, and insights generation.

## Project Development Steps

The development of this dashboard followed a structured approach to ensure accuracy and comprehensive insights:

1.  **Requirement Gathering/Business Requirements:** Understanding the core needs and objectives from stakeholders.
2.  **Data Walkthrough:** Initial exploration and understanding of the raw data.
3.  **Data Connection:** Establishing connections to the data sources.
4.  **Data Cleaning / Quality Check:** Ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and completeness.
5.  **Data Modeling:** Structuring the data for efficient analysis in Power BI.
6.  **Data Processing:** Transforming and preparing data for reporting.
7.  **DAX Calculations:** Developing custom measures and calculated columns using Data Analysis Expressions.
8.  **Dashboard Layouting:** Designing the visual structure and flow of the dashboards.
9.  **Charts Development and Formatting:** Creating and styling various visualizations.
10. **Dashboard / Report Development:** Assembling the complete interactive dashboards.
11. **Insights Generation:** Deriving meaningful conclusions and recommendations from the data.
